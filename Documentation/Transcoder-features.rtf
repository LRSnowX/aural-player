\f0\fs40 \cf0 Transcoder\
\
- Transcode on-demand when track is played\
	- User actions during transcoding (e.g. clicking on other tracks, adjusting volume/effects)\
	- Cancellation\
\
- Background task moving to foreground (user plays track once it has started transcoding in the background)\
	- TODO: Determine whether or not to cancel the existing background task and start a new one on the fast queue. \
		- Math: Check ratio of transcoding time for a big file \'85 background vs fast. LEt\'92s say 4:1. Then, check total time, time remaining vs est. time to transcode fast. Make decision.\
\
- Transcode in background (eager transcoding)\
	- All playlist files vs predictive\
	- Option to specify max number of concurrent background tasks \'85 check # of cores on system and make a recommendation based on that. 1 task per core recommended.\
\
- Transcode in background (requested by user)\
\
- Error cases:\
	- DRM protected files (e.g. Celtic Woman - Heart.wma)\
	- Non-audio files with audio extension (e.g. textFile.wma) \'85 make sure at least one audio stream\
	- Timeout - If transcoding is taking too long with no progress, time out\
\
- TODO: On startup, in TranscoderStore, validate all mappings (check if file actually exists), delete invalid mappings\
\
- View > Transcoder tasks ??? A window that shows all existing transcoder tasks with progress ?\
\
New file types:\
- WMA\
- FLAC\

- DSF\
\
