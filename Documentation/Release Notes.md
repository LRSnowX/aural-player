#  What's New in Version 3.19.0

## Bug Fixes 

### #57 - M3U playlist track import order  

Many thanks to @LesterJitsi for reporting this bug !

In versions v3.17.0 and v3.18.0, whenever an M3U playlist was imported into Aural, its tracks were inserted in random order. This bug has been fixed.

### #37 - No more modal dialogs

Again, thanks to @LesterJitsi for reporting this bug !

In all previous versions, all accessory dialog windows (eg. Preferences, Search, Sort, etc) were displayed modally, making it inconvenient for the user to switch between apps while those dialogs were displayed. Now, all those dialog windows are non-modal, so that when the user switches to another app, the dialog will be hidden.
