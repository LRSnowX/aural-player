#  What's New in Version 3.4.0

## Improved Playlist UI aesthetics

#### Title bar

The playlist window's title bar area has been modified, with icons for the 4 views, instead of textual captions, along with a single caption indicating the currently displayed view.

#### Auto-hiding controls

The toolbar at the bottom and the scrolling controls on the right side are now auto-hidden and only displayed when the user hovers the mouse cursor over the playlist window. This leads to a cleaner and less cluttered playlist UI appearance.

## Recorder feature removed

The somewhat dysfunctional Recorder unit has been removed completely. It may or may not be reinstated in the future.

### Bug fixes

* The "Customize font scheme" dialog's presets menu was missing some font scheme options. They have been added.

* The "Customize color scheme" dialog's presets menu was missing some color scheme options. They have been added.

* The font in several places (mostly labels) was improperly set to the system font. These labels have been fixed.

### Source code improvements

Lots of code refactoring, cleanup, and commenting.

### Unit testing

* Added some new unit tests for the audio graph and effects units.

* Added some new unit tests for the playlist search / sort features.

* Restored some unit tests that were previously decommisioned.
