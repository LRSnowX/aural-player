#  What's New in Version 3.9.0

## Support for Audio Unit (AU) plug-ins that don't provide a custom UI

As requested by [cesss](https://github.com/cesss), this release brings support for Audio Unit (AU) plug-ins that don't provide a custom GUI (knobs and sliders) - ex. AUMatrixReverb, AUSphericalHeadPanner, etc.

For such plug-ins, Aural Player will now dynamically generate a user interface with sliders and labels that the user can manipulate to control the plug-in.
