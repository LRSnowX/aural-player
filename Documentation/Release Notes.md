### "Start with empty playlist" user preference when launching from Finder with "Open With"

Thanks to @LesterJitsi for the bug report!

The playlist will now behave correctly based on the user preference when launching from Finder with "Open With", and the History > Recently Added list will now correctly display the appropriate (newly added) items.
