#  What's New in Version 2.9.0

## MusicBrainz cover art lookup

For tracks that don't have cover art but have artist and album / track title metadata, Aural Player will try to retrieve cover art for the track.

## Bug fix - Grouping Playlists

In rare cases when a track's metadata (eg artist) changed between app launches, the grouping playlists would cause a crash on app startup.
