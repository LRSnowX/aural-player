#  What's New in Version 2.13.0

## Tune Browser

Tune Browser is a Finder-like music browser that lets you explore the music collection on your local file system - folders, tracks, and playlists. It is tailored specifically to display and browse through music files, and has advanced filtering capabilities so you can find exactly the kind of music you're looking for. Search for files by file name, audio format, artist, album, genre, duration, etc.

From Tune Browser, you can add your folders / tracks / playlists directly into the Aural Player playlist and play them.
