#  What's New in Version 3.6.0

## History - Ability to resume last played track

You can now resume playback of the last played track at any time with one click by going to the menu **History > Resume last played track**. And the app will remember the last played track and position across app launches. 

So if you were listening to a long audiobook and then had to quit the app or stop playback, you can now easily resume from where you stopped listening the previous time.
