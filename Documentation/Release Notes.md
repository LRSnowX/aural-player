#  What's New in Version 3.12.0

## Current effects preset indication

The built-in effects units will now indicate the currently selected preset when applicable (i.e. no changes have been made after selecting a preset). The current preset for any effects unit can be discovered by opening its presets menu that is displayed via the "Load preset" button - the corresponding menu item will have a check mark next to it.

### Other changes

* Improvement - When a track that has remembered audio settings finishes playing, the previous audio settings will be restored.
* Bug fix - The Master presets menu button didn't do anything.
* Bug fix - Presets menu recreation failed in rare cases.
