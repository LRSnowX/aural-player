#  What's New in Version 3.8.0

## Support for MP4 and M4V (audio only)

As requested by [cesss](https://github.com/cesss), this release brings support for MP4 and M4V files.

Notes:
1 - Only the audio streams in MP4 / M4V files will be read by the app; the video streams will be ignored.
2 - Only native audio formats (AAC, AC-3, ALAC, MP1, MP2, MP3) will be supported. MP4 containers with audio formats such as Vorbis / Opus are not supported (perhaps in a future release).
