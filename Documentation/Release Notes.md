#  What's New in Version 3.14.0

## Simple/Advanced player controls views

Many thanks to @KalleNiemi for requesting this enhancement !

Some users would prefer not to see the following player controls, as they are rarely used:
* The A->B Segment loop button
* The L/R pan slider

Not showing the pan slider would make more room for the much more frequently used volume slider.

So, there are now 2 player controls views:
* Simple: In this view, the segment loop button and pan slider would both be hidden, making the volume slider wider.
* Advanced: In this view, all player controls would be shown (as before).

NOTE - The default view is the "Advanced" view, thus making all controls visible to new users so that they are aware of them.
