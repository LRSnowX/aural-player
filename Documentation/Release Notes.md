#  What's New in Version 2.2.0

### Messaging (back end) redesign

The messaging framework has been redesigned as a thin wrapper around NotificationCenter, resulting in much cleaner and more concise notification handling code throughout the app.

### Bug fixes

* (Playlist) When all tracks are removed from the playlist, the summary (number of tracks) is not updated in some rare cases.
