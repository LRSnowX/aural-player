#  What's New in Version 3.12.1

## Bug fix #46 - Opening files from Finder

Many thanks to Laurent sourdaux for reporting this bug !

Previously, when opening files from Finder, the first track in the playlist would always begin playing, regardless of which file was opened. This bug has been fixed.
If multiple files are selected in Finder, the first one will play.
