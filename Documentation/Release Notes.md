#  What's New in Version 2.7.0

## Real-time playback of non-native tracks

Aural Player is now able to decode and immediately play tracks of non-native audio formats (e.g. Vorbis, APE, True Audio, WMA, etc), without any delay. So, the user experience is much improved, and identical to that for playback of natively supported tracks.

Previously, tracks of non-native audio formats were first transcoded and then the output of the transcoding process was played by the player. This resulted in a significant delay before playback, and a less-than-ideal experience for the user.
