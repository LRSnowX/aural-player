#  What's New in Version 3.25.1

## Fixed Last.fm scrobbling bugs

### Measuring playback time

The way Aural measures how long a track was played back for, has been improved.

### Character encoding

Previously, track metadata with Unicode characters having symbols such as accents or umlauts was not encoded properly, resulted in failed scrobbling requests.
