#  What's New in Version 3.5.5

## Fixed Filter unit crash and preset bug

1 - The Filter effects unit had a bug causing it to crash under certain circumstances when a preset was applied and bands were subsequently removed. This has been fixed.
2 - The Filter effects unit's "No bass" preset was incorrectly configured, allowing all frequencies through. This bug has been fixed so that this preset now eliminates bass frequencies from the audio output.
