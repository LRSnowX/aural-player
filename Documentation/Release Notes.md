#  What's New in Version 3.0.0

This release brings lots of new features, and user interface and usability improvements.

## Unified interface

In addition to the Winamp-style modular interface, there is now also a single-window "Unified" interface that presents all the information in one place.

## Real-time playback of non-native formats

Previously, tracks of non-native formats (eg. Vorbis / APE) would have to be transcoded prior to playback, resulting in a non-ideal user experience. Now, they will be decoded and played back in real-time, like tracks of any native Core Audio format.

## Support for more non-native audio formats

In addition to the non-native formats already supported, True Audio, TAK (Tom's Audiokompressor), RealAudio, and other non-native formats are now also supported.

## Visualizer

The new visualizer module displays a real-time visualization of the audio currently playing. Three types of visualization are available, with customizable colors and other options.

## Better track organization - Library, play queue, and custom playlists

Three new modules allow for much better organization of your favorite tracks and albums.

* Library:  The universe of your managed audio collection. Allows custom groupings.
* Play Queue:  See and precisely control what's playing. Set repeat counts, duplicate tracks, define track segments. Export to a custom playlist within the app or to an M3U file.
* Custom playlists:  Create any number of playlists and keep them within easy reach. Export to an M3U file with a click.

Other improvements:

* Searching and sorting has been enhanced and made more efficient.
* Drag/drop to transfer tracks across the different modules. For example, create custom playlists from the play queue, library, file system folders, or an album. Play tracks from any of the modules with ease.  

## File system browser

The new built-in file system browser module lets you search through your Mac for supported files and playlists. Use the advanced search to find tracks by various file system and metadata fields. Add tracks to the library or create custom playlists from folders.
