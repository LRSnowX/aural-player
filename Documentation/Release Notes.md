#  What's New in Version 3.5.1

## Fixed log generation error

For some time now, the app bundle has not been generating the log file that helps troubleshoot issues with the app.

## Fixed color scheming issue

The recently re-designed Time Stretch effects unit was not properly redrawing when color scheme changes were applied. This has now been fixed.
