#  What's New in Version 3.1.0

## Remote Control and Now Playing Info

*Remote Control* is the ability of Aural Player to be controlled from outside the application, for example, from the macOS Control Center (available in Big Sur) or by Apple accessories (eg. headphones) that are able to send ***MPRemoteCommand*** audio commands to macOS. Exposed functions include play / pause, previous / next track, skipping forward / backward, or seeking to an arbitrary playback position. 

*Now Playing Info* is the display of current audio information within the "Now Playing" section of the macOS Control Center and/or the associated player widget that attaches to the menu bar. This includes the currently playing track's title, artist, album, cover art, playback position, etc.

This feature provides the abillity to control Aural Player through a familiar native interface such as Control Center, without having to switch to the app, and is also an allternative to using media keys.

**NOTE** - This feature's capabilities are roughly comparable to that of Aural Player running in menu bar mode, although menu bar mode does provide some extra functions such as volume control, repeat, shuffle, segment looping, etc. 

### Remote Control not available in menu bar mode

Note that when running Aural Player in menu bar mode, it will *not* be able to receive Remote Control commands.
