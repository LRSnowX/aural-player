#  What's New in Version 2.11.0

## Themes

Themes provide the convenience of applying all appearance settings (font scheme, color scheme, window appearance, etc.) in a single step by encapsulating all those settings in a single object. You can use built-in themes, or create and save your own hand-tailored themes for future use.

### Poolside.fm theme

This release adds a single built-in theme: Poolside.fm to demonstrate the themes feature. This theme is based on the theme on the poolside.fm website and was conceived of and designed by app user [yougotwill](https://github.com/yougotwill).

### Window corner (rounding) radius

The corner (rounding) radius of the app's 4 main windows is now user-customizable. It can be set to a value ranging from 0 pixels to 25 pixels.

There are 2 ways to modify the window corner radius setting, 

1 - From the settings popup menu at the top right corner of the main (player) window, find the menu item **Window Corner Radius** 
2 - From the main menu item **View > Window Corner Radius**

Use the stepper control to adjust the value as desired.

### Creating a new theme

You can create a new theme consisting of an existing font scheme and color scheme. To access this feature, do one of the following:

* From the settings popup menu at the top right corner of the main (player) window, find the menu item **Create new theme** 
* From the main menu item **View > Create new theme**

Clicking one of these menu items will pop up a dialog. On this dialog, choose options for your new theme and click Ok to save it.

### Themes manager

The themes manager allows users to preview, rename, apply, and/or delete user-defined themes. This is useful if:

* You want to give your themes more meaningful or cooler names.
* You've forgotten what one of your custom themes looks like, and want to visually preview it.
* You have duplicates or simply want to reduce clutter and delete old themes no longer preferred or in use.

Access the themes manager by going to **View > Manage themes**.

NOTE - You cannot alter built-in themes ... only your own.

### Bug fix - Playlist rows misalignment

In some cases, certain playlist rows would be displayed with their icon and text misaligned. This bug has been fixed.

### Bug fix - Window snapping crash

In some cases, window snapping against the edges of the screen would result in a crash due to a null reference. This issue has been fixed.
