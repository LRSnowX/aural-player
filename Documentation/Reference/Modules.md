#  Overview of modules

## Library

The Library module conceptually represents the superset of all your managed tracks. Tracks are organized (sorted / grouped) by various criteria such as artist / album / genre, can be searched, queued for playback, or added to a custom playlist.

## Play Queue

The Play Queue module consists of an ordered list of tracks that have been currently chosen for playback. Tracks can be reordered, and their play / repeat counts can be modified.

## File System Browser

The File System Browser module lets you browse your file system for supported tracks / playlists / folders. Items can be added to the library or play queue. Supports searching with various file / track metadata as criteria.

## History

The History module displays tracks / playlists / folders that were recently played / added, sorted chronologically. Items can be queued for playback.

## Visualizer

The Visualizer module displays a visual representation of the sound being output by Aural Player. Some displays take the entire sound spectrum into account while others are beat (or bass) emphasized.
