Instructions to build FFmpeg from source

1 - Open a terminal window
2 - cd to the directory containing this README.txt file (and the FFmpeg build script and source code archive). This step is important. The build script will assume that you have done this and will not work otherwise.
3 - Run "./build-ffmpeg.sh" and wait till it is finished executing
4 - The newly built FFmpeg binaries "ffmpeg" and "ffprobe" will be in this directory
