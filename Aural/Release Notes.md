#  What's New in Version 2.0.0


## **Color schemes support**

Aural Player now allows extensive customization of its UI colors and comes with a few built-in color schemes you can choose from. You can customize the color of pretty much every component on the application's 4 main windows, and can save your hand-tailored color schemes for future use.

### **Demo**

See a color schemes demo [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maculateConception/aural-player/master/Documentation/Demos/ColorSchemes.gif)

### **Color scheme editor panel**

The new color scheme editor panel can be accessed either by going to **View > Color Scheme > Customize** under the main menu bar or from the settings popup menu at the top right corner of the main (player) window, by clicking **Color Scheme > Customize**.

* **Instant preview**  - The panel modifies the system color scheme as you change the colors of different elements, so you can instantly see how your chosen colors look in the UI.

* **38 different UI elements** whose colors can be customized. Some elements, such as sliders, allow further customization in the form of gradients.

* **Undo/redo functionality** - You can roll back/forward individual changes (or all at once) to different versions of your customized scheme (history is reset when the panel is closed).

* **Color clipboard** - You can copy a color you used for one UI element, and paste it onto another color picker for a different UI element, reducing tedious work.

* **Apply/save preset schemes** - From the panel, you can load a preset color scheme as a starting point, modify a few colors, then save the new version as your own custom scheme, so you can create several variations of color schemes. You don't need to start from scratch everytime.

NOTE - Only the current system color scheme (i.e. the current scheme of the app UI) will be altered by this panel. Any preset you have applied will remain unchanged (presets only serve as a starting point).

### **Built-in color schemes**

There are 6 built-in color schemes, one of which is the default scheme, "Black attack", that is applied when the app is started up for the first time before altering the color scheme.

They can be accessed from the submenu under **View > Color Scheme** or from the settings popup menu at the top right corner of the main (player) window, under the **Color Scheme** submenu. They can also be applied from within the editor panel.

### **Color schemes manager**

The new color schemes manager allows users to preview, rename, apply, and/or delete user-defined color schemes. This is useful if:

* You want to give your schemes more meaningful or cooler names.
* You've forgotten what one of your custom schemes looks like, and want to preview it.
* You have duplicates or simply want to reduce clutter and delete old schemes no longer preferred or in use.

Access the color schemes manager by going to **View > Manage color schemes**.

NOTE - You cannot alter built-in color schemes ... only your own.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in the expanded art player view - During delayed playback, album art wasn't being loaded sometimes.

### UI aesthetics

UI aesthetics have been enhanced in this release.

* Brand new better looking fonts (packaged with app bundle).
* Album art frame now displays a shadow, giving it a 3D appearance.
* Some new/smaller icons.
* Sleeker looking selected tab markers.
* Thinner sleeker sliders in player window.
