#  What's New in Version 1.6.0


## **Selecting an audio output device**

The ability to select an audio output device comes new in this latest release. Previously, Aural Player would always send its audio to the system's current output device.

For instance, you can now choose to send Aural's audio output to your Bluetooth speakers while macOS can send its output to any other device like headphones or a Macbook Pro's built-in speakers

You will find this new feature in the Sound menu. There is a new menu item labeled "Output Device". Hovering over this item will reveal a menu listing all available audio output devices, with the current one selected. Click on any of these items to change your output device as preferred.

## **Setting a preferred audio output device (on app startup)**

Also, the Preferences dialog now offers a new setting, under the ***Sound*** tab, to allow users to configure which output device should be used at app startup, under the heading ***Output device on app startup*** There are 3 options available:

1 - ***Use system device*** - The current macOS output device will be used.

2 - ***Remember device from last app launch*** - Whatever output device was used when the app previously exited will be remembered and used, if it is still available. If it is no longer available, Aural Player will default to the system output device.

3 - ***Use preferred device*** - You can choose from a list of all available devices. This setting can be used if, for instance, you always want Aural Player to send its output to a particular device like your headphones or external speakers. As long as that same device is available when Aural Player starts up again, it will be selected for use. If not, Aural Player will default to the system output device.
