### Background

Aural Player was written by an audio enthusiast learning to program on OS X, coming to Swift programming from many years of Java programming. This project was inspired by the developerâ€™s desire to create a Winamp-like substitute for the macOS platform. No feature bloat or unnecessary annoyances like iTunes.

## Planned updates

**A->B Playback looping** - The user will now be able to repeat a track segment by defining two arbitrary loop points with an easy keyboard shortcut.

**New app views** - There will be a status bar view that will be accessible through the macOS status bar and an ultra-compact floating "mini bar" view that provides essential controls and always remains on top for easy access when running the app in the "background".

## Recent updates

11/17/2017: **Playlist contextual menu** - When a playlist item is right/control-clicked, the app will now display a contextual menu with functions applicable to the clicked item. Certain functions that could only be performed on the playing track will now be able to be performed on any playlist track - adding/removing a track to/from Favorites list, getting detailed track info.

11/16/2017: **Gesture recognition (trackpad/MagicMouse users)** - Users with a trackpad or MagicMouse can now perform essential player/playlist functions like track selection, seeking, volume control, and playlist scrolling (top/bottom), with simple and familiar gestures like 3-finger swipes or two-finger scrolls.

11/14/2017: **History: Favorites list and recent items lists** - The app now manages a Favorites list to which users can add/remove tracks. It also maintains historical usage in terms of 2 lists: recently added files/folders, and recently played tracks. The lists are displayed in menus, and users can select items from these lists with one single click to either play or add an item to the playlist.

11/4/2017: **App now distributed in DMG, not ZIP** - The downloadable app bundle will now be available in a DMG disk image file. The old ZIP archive will no longer be provided.

11/4/2017: **Fixed window positioning on startup** - Window positioning on startup was broken after introduction of the resizable playlist. That has been fixed and is smarter - takes visible screen frame into account, so that app windows are not pushed behind the MacOS dock.

11/3/2017: **New playlist views with track groups** - In addition to the current flat view, new views have been added to the playlist, which group tracks by album, artist, genre, etc. This allows for convenient playlist browsing.

11/3/2018: **UI refresh** - A lot of UI elements have been redone, for a sleeker appearance. Window corners, background colors, slider controls, playlist summary, etc.
