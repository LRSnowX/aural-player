Aural Player v4.0 aims to take the app to the next level, bringing improvements such as:

- A new "Unified" (single window) app presentation mode. NOTE - The existing modular UI mode will remain.
- The playlist becomes the "play queue" and the user can now save multiple playlists.
- Nicer user interface aesthetics (look and feel)
- Simplified theming (fonts and colors)
- Improved usability
- A lot more help and tool tips
- Gapless queueing of tracks (eliminating audible gaps between tracks and segment loops)
- Cleaner source code and use of newer APIs
- Possibly an app version for iPadOS
- Possibly online streaming
- Possibly a file browser with advanced search capabilities
