### Background

Aural Player was written by an audio enthusiast learning to program on OS X, coming to Swift programming from many years of Java programming. This project was inspired by the developerâ€™s desire to create a Winamp-like substitute for the macOS platform. No feature bloat or unnecessary annoyances like iTunes.

### Third party code and contributor attributions

Aural Player makes use of (a modified version of) a reusable UI control called [RangeSlider](https://github.com/matthewreagan/RangeSlider).

Fellow GitHub member [Dunkeeel](https://github.com/Dunkeeel) made significant contributions towards this project - performance optimizations, UX improvements, etc.
