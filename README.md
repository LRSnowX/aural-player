- Track segment looping, to allow you to loop your favorite parts of a track
- Display of ID3 and iTunes metadata, including artwork (when available)
- Bookmarking, so you can mark a specific position within a track, and come back to it later, which is great for long tracks like audiobooks **(New!)**

- Extensive set of keyboard shortcuts and menu items for quick and convenient access to functionality
- Numerous preferences to allow user to highly customize functionality (e.g. seek/volume/pan increment, enabling/disabling and mouse sensitivity for gestures, configurable window layout and snapping behavior, remembered/default playlist on startup, etc.)

### Planned updates

- A new editor window to manage effects presets

### Recent updates

- **10/04/2018: New release:**
  * New features:
    * **New Master effects unit**: A new effects unit called "Master" has been added to the effects panel. This unit has controls to enable/disable all effects units from one place and provides the ability to capture all sound effects in a single "master" preset.
    
  * Bug fixes:
    * **Headphones plugged in crash**: When headphones are plugged in/out, the app stops playing audio. Now, this works during normal track playback, but still fails during track segment loop playback. A fix for the loop playback crash is planned and coming soon.

- **9/28/2018: New release:** Bug fix - On High Sierra systems, app crashed at the completion of an iteration of a playback loop. This issue has been fixed.

- **9/26/2018: New release:** Favorites items now have their own separate Favorites menu on the main menu bar, entirely separate from the History menu. Also, favorites lists are no longer restricted in size.

- **9/25/2018: New release:**
  * New features:
    * **Configurable window spacing**: The user can now configure the spacing between windows when windows are snapped together. The user can specify a value between 0 and 25 pixels, as per his visual preference.
    * **Layouts editor**: The user can now manage user-defined window layouts within a new editor window. In addition to being able to rename and delete layouts, the editor window will display an accurately scaled graphical preview of the layout.

- **9/24/2018: New release:**
  * New features:
    * **Bookmarks editor and Favorites editor**: The user can now manage bookmarks (rename and/or delete them) and favorites (delete unwanted ones) with a new editor window.
    * **Playlist file on startup**: The user can now specify a preference that, on app startup, the playlist should load tracks from a specific (M3U/M3U8) playlist file. This option can be found in the Playlist tab of the Preferences dialog.
    * **Seeking/looping/replaying tracks when paused**: Previously, seeking, looping, and replaying tracks could only be done while the player was playing (as opposed to paused). This limitation no longer exists.
    
  * Bug fixes:
    * **History/Favorites bug**: When history/favorites lists are resized, menus and other UI elements need to be updated. They weren't always being updated, resulting in weird UI states.

- **9/22/2018: New release with lots of updates:**
  * New features:
    * **Bookmarking**: The user can now mark a specific position in a track, and it will be saved with a name/description the user can provide. The user can then return to that track position later with one click. This is great when listening to long files like audiobooks or podcasts.
    * **New window layouts and user-defined layouts**: The way windows are laid out has been simplified and made easier for the user. The user can choose from multiple built-in window layouts, or lay out the windows per his preference and save the layout as a preset for later use. **Window snapping**, to other app windows, and to screen corners and edges for added convenience.
    * **FX unit presets**: Each effects unit now allows the saving of settings as a preset, so the user can save all his sound settings as presets for later use with just one click.
    * **Dynamic tool tips**: The previous/next track buttons of the player controls now show the name of the previous/next track, as tool tips, so the user can know, before clicking the button, which track will play as a result.
    
  * Improvements:
    * Performance improvement: No more GIF animations. Only static images are shown to indicate a playing track. This has reduced CPU usage by about 60%..
    
  * The following bugs have been fixed:
    * Audio engine crash upon app exit, causing corruption of app state file, resulting in loss of all saved settings and user presets/data.
    * When playing a track from Favorites/Recently played list, the first 5 seconds of the track would sometimes play twice in a row, because of a race condition in the code that performed preparation for track playback.
    * The playlist scroll buttons stopped working at some point.

### Background

Aural Player was written by an audio enthusiast learning to program on OS X, coming to Swift programming from many years of Java programming. This project was inspired by the developerâ€™s desire to create a Winamp-like substitute for the macOS platform. No feature bloat or unnecessary annoyances like iTunes.

### Third party code and contributor attributions

Aural Player makes use of (a modified version of) a reusable UI control called [RangeSlider](https://github.com/matthewreagan/RangeSlider).

Fellow GitHub member [Dunkeeel](https://github.com/Dunkeeel) made significant contributions towards this project - performance optimizations, UX improvements, etc.
