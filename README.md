### Compatibility

**User**: Running Aural Player requires OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or later macOS versions.

**Developer**: To develop Aural Player with Swift 3 (master branch) requires macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and XCode 8.x. To develop Aural Player with Swift 2 ("swift2" branch) requires OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or later and XCode 7.x.

### Background

Aural Player was written by an audio enthusiast learning to program on OS X, coming to Swift programming from many years of Java programming. This project was inspired by the developerâ€™s desire to create a Winamp-like substitute for the macOS platform. No feature bloat or unnecessary annoyances like iTunes.

## Recent updates

11/4/2017: **App now distributed in DMG, not ZIP** - The downloadable app bundle will now be available in a DMG disk image file. The old ZIP archive will no longer be provided.

11/4/2017: **Fixed window positioning on startup** - Window positioning on startup was broken after introduction of the resizable playlist. That has been fixed and is smarter - takes visible screen frame into account, so that app windows are not pushed behind the MacOS dock.

11/3/2017: **New playlist views with track groups** - In addition to the current flat view, new views have been added to the playlist, which group tracks by album, artist, genre, etc. This allows for convenient playlist browsing.

11/3/2018: **UI refresh** - A lot of UI elements have been redone, for a sleeker appearance. Window corners, background colors, slider controls, playlist summary, etc.

10/15/2017: **Multiple selection, type selection, and drag/drop reordering in playlist** - The playlist now allows selection of multiple items at once, and type selection to find tracks quickly by typing their name. Also, it now allows reordering by dragging and dropping. This makes reordering, and/or removal of multiple playlist tracks much less tedious, and provides a quick way to search for tracks by name. (Full-fledged search is still available)

10/12/2017: **New playlist navigation functions** - New functions have been added for more convenient playlist navigation. These include: 1 - Show playing track within playlist, 2 - Scroll to top of playlist, and 3 - Scroll to bottom of playlist.

10/12/2017: **Resizable, detachable, and movable playlist** - The playlist is now resizable, detachable, and movable, with buttons to conveniently snap/attach the playlist to the main app window, in different relative locations (bottom, right, left, etc), and smart maximizing.

Aural Player makes use of (a modified version of) a reusable UI control called [RangeSlider](https://github.com/matthewreagan/RangeSlider).
